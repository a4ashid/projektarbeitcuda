 4.2 set command customization  
 Customization of the axis ranges, axis labels, and plot title, as well as many other features, are specified using the set command. Specific examples of the set command follow. (The numerical values used in these examples are arbitrary.) To view your changes type: replot at the gnuplot> prompt at any time. 
      Create a title:                  > set title "Force-Deflection Data" 
      Put a label on the x-axis:       > set xlabel "Deflection (meters)"
      Put a label on the y-axis:       > set ylabel "Force (kN)"
      Change the x-axis range:         > set xrange [0.001:0.005]
      Change the y-axis range:         > set yrange [20:500]
      Have Gnuplot determine ranges:   > set autoscale
      Move the key:                    > set key 0.01,100
      Delete the key:                  > unset key
      Put a label on the plot:         > set label "yield point" at 0.003, 260 
      Remove all labels:               > unset label
      Plot using log-axes:             > set logscale
      Plot using log-axes on y-axis:   > unset logscale; set logscale y 
      Change the tic-marks:            > set xtics (0.002,0.004,0.006,0.008)
      Return to the default tics:      > unset xtics; set xtics auto
